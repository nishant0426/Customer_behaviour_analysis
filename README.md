## ⚙️ Project Steps  

### 1. **Data Loading**  
- Loaded dataset using **Pandas** in Python.  
- Checked data types, column names, and structure.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Used **describe(), info()** to understand data.  
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  

### 3. **Data Cleaning**  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.  
- Fixed incorrect data types and standardized date formats.  
- Created new calculated columns for better insights.  

### 4. **SQL Analysis**
